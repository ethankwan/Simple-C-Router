## Acknowledgement

This implementation is based on the original code for Stanford CS144 lab3 (https://bitbucket.org/cs144-1617/lab3).

## Functionality 

Developed a router with a static routing table using Mininet to emulate a
network topology. The router receives and forwards Ethernet frames (ARP,
IPv4) to the correct outgoing interface. Supports client-server file transfer
